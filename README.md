## Getting Started

1. [Fork](https://github.com/the3ash/astro-chiri/fork) this repository, or use this template to [create a new repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=astro-chiri&template_owner=the3ash).

2. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>

   cd <your-repo-name>

   pnpm install

   pnpm dev
   ```

3. Edit `src/config.ts` and `src/content/about/about.md` to your liking.

4. Use `pnpm new <title>` to create new posts, or add your posts to `src/content/posts`.

5. Build with `pnpm build` and deploy the generated `dist/` directory to any static hosting platform. Link Card metadata is fetched automatically during `pnpm dev` and `pnpm build` and stored in `src/data/link-card-metadata.json` so cards render as static HTML.

- This template now includes a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/pages.yml` to build and deploy the site to GitHub Pages automatically on `master` branch pushes.
- Add a `.nojekyll` file in the repo root to prevent GitHub Pages from trying to run Jekyll on Astro source files.
- Make sure your repository Pages source is set to **GitHub Actions** in GitHub Settings, not to the repository root branch.
- If you are using GitHub Pages, update `src/config.ts` → `themeConfig.site.website` to your Pages URL (`https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`), or your custom domain.
